Game of Life

Description:

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input from the player. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves according to simple rules.

Usage:

This Java program simulates the Game of Life. To use it, follow these steps:

Compile the program using a Java compiler.
Prepare a text file containing the initial state of the game grid. Each cell in the grid should be represented by a 0 or 1, indicating dead or alive, respectively. Use whitespace to separate cells, and ensure that each row has the same number of cells.
Run the compiled program and provide the filename (without the extension) of the text file containing the initial state when prompted.
Enter the number of generations for which you want to simulate the game.
Sit back and observe the evolution of the Game of Life!
File Structure:

GameOfLife.java: The main Java source code file containing the implementation of the Game of Life.
README.md: This file, providing instructions and information about the program.
src/: Directory containing the input text file(s) for the initial state of the game grid.
Requirements:

Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system to compile and run the program.
Text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to view and edit the source code.
